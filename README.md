All modules in the `itv_asset_tree` package are included and grouped by feature domain.

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Access to the external code repository containing the `itv_asset_tree` package
- See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies

## üìù Style Guide

To ensure complete documentation coverage, all classes, functions, and methods in `itv_asset_tree` should include [Google-style Python docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings). MkDocs + mkdocstrings will render them automatically.
